# [The LIGO data was analyzed in Python](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html)

&nbsp;

Why?

# Python can be your single language.

It's good for

<ul>
<li class="fragment"> Running other programs
<li class="fragment"> Parsing output and assembling results
<li class="fragment"> Implementing algorithms*
<li class="fragment"> Group coding
</ul>


# pandas enables data analysis in Python

&nbsp;

* Central object: the data frame
* Read/write tabular data in a variety of formats
* Many ways to slice up data and apply functions
* Plotting integration with Matplotlib


# Alternatives

&nbsp;

* R (see next slide)
* Perl/Ruby (if you like more flexibility)
* Julia (more purpose-built for science; faster)


# You should use R if

&nbsp;

* Classical statistical modeling is your primary goal
* There are packages that suit your needs (e.g. Bioconductor)
* Everyone in your sub-discipline uses R
* Systems-level programming is less of a concern
* You aren't bothered by having five object systems


# IMHO

&nbsp;

* pandas has far fewer gotchas, and they are documented
* Python has less special syntax (verbosity vs clarity)
* Having one language is a big win
* Machine learning is stronger in Python
* Cython is very pleasant to use

&nbsp;

* R is more mature, and better documented
* ggplot2 is better than Matplotlib
* Statistics is much stronger in R
